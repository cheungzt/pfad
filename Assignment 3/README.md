This is a project implemented using **Pygame**. Users can enter RGB color values ​​in the Pygame window. Each time the Enter key is pressed, a ball of the corresponding color will be generated. The generated ball will move randomly on the screen and bounce when it collides with the border.
 

### Instructions
1. After starting the program, a Pygame window will appear with an input box.
2. Click the input box to activate it, and then enter the RGB color value in the format of R,G,B (e.g. 255,0,0 for red).
3. Press the Enter key, and a ball of the corresponding color will be generated on the screen and start to move randomly within the window.
4. Repeatedly enter the RGB color value to generate more balls, each of which will move freely at different speeds and bounce off the boundaries.
#### Example demonstration
* Input RGB: 0,255,0 (generate a green ball)
* Input RGB: 0,0,255 (generate a blue ball)
